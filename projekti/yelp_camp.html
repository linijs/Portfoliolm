                        <p>
                            In this personal project, my primary focus was to
                            create a full-stack web application that is a
                            responsive and safe environment for the user. The
                            authentication was implemented with common security
                            issues like SQL Injection, XSS, etc. prevention in
                            mind. The sites was built with the CSS Framework
                            Bootstrap 5. NodeJS was used to write server-side
                            JavaScript With the help of Express and MongoDB I
                            created this full-stack JavaScript application The
                            user can view and rate campground as well as create,
                            edit and delete their own campgrounds. Users
                            authentication and authorization is encrypted and
                            stored using Node.js tool called Passport. The user
                            has the option to upload an image to the website. I
                            used a cloud database tool called Cloudinary to
                            store these images. I used Mapbox to determine where
                            an user created campground is located as well as
                            their Geocoding API to pin the exact location on the
                            map. Using the Mapbox API, the site has an
                            interactive cluster map of all the created
                            campgrounds. The database is stored in Mongo Atlas.
